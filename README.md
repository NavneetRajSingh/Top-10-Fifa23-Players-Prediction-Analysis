# Top-10-Fifa23-Players-Prediction-Analysis

Introduction:
  
  This Machine Learning project aims to predict the top 10 players in FIFA 23 using a dataset consisting of various player attributes. The dataset includes features such as 'Overall', 'Wage', 'Special', 'International Reputation', 'PlayerValue', and 'ReleaseValue'. We used feature engineering techniques like Robust Scaler and MinMaxScaler to preprocess the data and employed data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to gain insights into the dataset. In this project, we implemented a predictive model that ranks players based on their overall performance and other relevant attributes.

Dataset:

  The dataset used for this project contains information about FIFA 23 players and their attributes. It is available in the 'data' directory of this repository. The 'players.csv' file includes the following features:

'Overall': The overall rating of the player in FIFA 23.
'Wage': The weekly wage of the player.
'Special': A numeric value representing the player's special attributes.
'International Reputation': The international reputation of the player.
'PlayerValue': The market value of the player in terms of in-game currency.
'ReleaseValue': The release clause value of the player.

Feature Engineering:

  For data preprocessing, we applied two different scaling techniques: Robust Scaler and MinMaxScaler. These techniques were used to ensure the features are scaled appropriately for better model performance.

Data Visualization:

  To gain insights and better understand the dataset, we utilized various visualization techniques. We employed Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create meaningful visualizations of the dataset, distribution of attributes, and relationships between features.
